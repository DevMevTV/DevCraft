# VERY WIP MINECRAFT SERVER SOFTWARE
This is a Minecraft Server Software made in rust, to give much better performance.

To build it, youll need to [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then run "cargo build" in the Command Prompt.
To then run the server, you need to go in a terminal and run the builded file via the terminal.
